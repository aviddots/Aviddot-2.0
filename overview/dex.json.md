# ðŸš§ Dex.json

The dex.json file comes with a series of ready-to-use dexes

The file starts with a brace ' eg. { 'before the first number and numbers are enclosed in quotation marks ' eg "0" ' The file must always end with a brace ' eg } ' placed at the end of the file (as distributed). If you have any problems, please re-download the file.

You can see the number 0 on the PancakeSwap dex

The number 0 will always be the dex that will be loaded when the bot starts, so you can set your favorite dex as number 0.

{% hint style="warning" %}
There cannot be two zero numbers, so you will have to swap the numbers in case you want to change the position of the dex!
{% endhint %}

## :coin: COIN

* "main\__coin\__symbol" - The symbol of the main coin for that chain

{% hint style="warning" %}
The symbol is important for the proper functioning of the bots. to be sure that the symbol is correct, look for the main con in the respective explorer (for example, look for bnb on bscexplorer) You will notice that the symbol for BNB is actually WBNB So you will have to enter WBNB in "main\_coin\_symbol"
{% endhint %}



* "peg\__coin\__contract" - The address of one peg coin for that chain 'eg. BUSD for bsc'
* "peg\__coin\__symbol" - The symbol of the coin
* "peg\__coin\_2_contract" - The address of one peg coin for that chain 'eg. USDT for bsc'
* "peg\__coin\_2_symbol" - The symbol of the coin
* "selfadded\__coin\__contract" - The address of any peg coin you want to add
* "selfadded\__coin\__symbol" - The symbol of the selfadded coin

{% hint style="warning" %}
For the bot to work correctly it is necessary to fill in all the fields of the relative dex. Even if you don't want to add a coin, copy the peg coin address and symbol from one of the fields above so you don't leave it blank.
{% endhint %}
