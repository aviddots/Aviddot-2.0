# üîç Mempool Scan

{% hint style="warning" %}
The transactions for adding or removing liquidity (add Liquidity etc ...) are sent to the Router address.&#x20;

While enable trading transactions (TradingEnabled, EnableTrading etc ...) are sent to the token address.
{% endhint %}

The bot can scan either on the router address or on the token address.

Depending on the transaction you are looking for, you will need to select Trading enabled or addingliquidity. After that you will have to enter the methoids in the corresponding field.

## How to find MethoId for Enable Trading

First of all search for the token in the reference scanner (bscsca, etherscan etc ...)

Than click on Contract -> Write Contract

Now look for the name of the method which appears to be to enable trading (or whatever other method you want to intercept)
